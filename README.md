# RSA_Cryptography_Cryptanalysis
Using python language, it is a system for chat through sockets, using RSA algorithm to encrypt/decrypt the chat texts between two users, then making cryptanalysis for RSA breaking 

## Before Run
1-Download anaconda  

  For windows:
  
    https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/
    
  For linux:
  
    https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/
    

3-Download sympy and pandas from anaconda:

  open Vscode from anaconda
  
  in the terminal write:
  
      conda install sympy  
      
      conda install pandas

## How to run 
1-Open Vscode from anaconda

2-Split Terminal and run server file

3-Then run client file

4-After some chatting, kill both runs,then run the attacker 

5-Now run the analysis code to plot the results 

Steps in commands:

Chatting:

     python server.py

     python client.py
     
Attacking

      python chatAttack.py

Analysis

      python analysis.py
